# EmployeeAssignmentProblem
Pretend you are data scientist charged with the task of helping the HR department with resource allocation across the business.  
The hope is that if we can use machine learning to successfully predict task completions (as well when tasks are likely to NOT be completed) 
then HR can make better decisions about team assignments.
